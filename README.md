## Overview

Linkedin Post Generator is an LLM-powered productivity application that automates or dramatically accelerates a specific professional workflow. It combines carefully designed prompts, structured output parsing, and a clean user interface to deliver results that would take hours manually in seconds.

The application is built on a modular prompt architecture: each workflow step has a dedicated prompt template with clear instructions, output format specification, and example outputs (few-shot). This makes the LLM behaviour predictable, consistent, and easy to audit.

All generated content is presented in a structured, editable format before any export or download, allowing the user to review and refine AI output before using it. The tool is designed to augment human judgment, not replace it.

---

## Motivation

Professional content creation — writing, structuring, and polishing documents, posts, and materials — consumes enormous amounts of time that could be spent on higher-value thinking. This tool applies LLMs where they are most powerful: producing well-structured, professionally toned first drafts that humans can quickly review and finalise.

## Architecture

```
User input (topic, tone, parameters)
        │
  Prompt construction (template + user data)
        │
  LLM API call (GPT-4o / Gemini)
        │
  Output parsing and formatting
        │
  Edit interface → Export (PDF/DOCX/Markdown)
```

## Features

### AI Content Generation
LLM-powered generation of professional content tailored to specific tone, audience, and purpose parameters.

### Template Library
Pre-built prompt templates for common use cases, customisable for specific needs.

### Iterative Refinement
Regenerate individual sections or the full output with adjusted parameters without restarting from scratch.

### Tone and Style Control
Select from professional/formal, conversational, technical, creative, or concise tone profiles.

### Multi-Format Export
Export generated content as PDF, Word document, or Markdown for downstream use.

### Version Comparison
Side-by-side comparison of multiple generated versions to select the best output.

### History Management
Save and restore previous sessions, preventing loss of good outputs.

### API Backend Flexibility
Switch between OpenAI, Gemini, and other backends via environment variable.
